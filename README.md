This Service should handle your Users as Anonymous Entities to keep in accordance with EU 2016/679.
Returns for given Data either a new User or an exisiting User, containing the Hash,Salt and "Random" Displayname

## Legality
That way, you dont store any Data that can be linked to a natural Person.
Which should in turn save you from any Privacy concerns. 
But as always: IANAL/IANYL

## License
Some Open Source License is planned.
